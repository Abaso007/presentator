Presentator UI
======================================================================

This is the Presentator UI (built with Svelte and Vite).

Although it could be used independently, it is mainly intended to be embedded
as part of the Presentator app executable (hence the `embed.go` file).

## Development

Download the repo and run the appropriate console commands:

```sh
# install dependencies
npm install

# start a dev server with hot reload at localhost:5173
npm run dev

# run prettier
npm run format

# generate production ready bundle
npm run build
```
